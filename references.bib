He willingly adopts the view that evolution is an engineering problem, which is opposed to those like Gould who believe evolution is more about random chance than incremental solution. Although Dennett supports Dawkins' notion of memes, he is not hopeful of a rigorous science of mimetics. Rather, he concludes that cultural evolution must occur because it meets the same requirements in the abstract as are required fro biological evolution.}

An example of open diffusion is exhibited by van de Waal et al. (2013a). The human experiments were even more mixed, with some diffusion experiments demonstrating an increase in the complexity of the signal (e.g., Caldwell {\&} Millen, 2009) and others demonstrating a simplification of the signal being transmitted (Caldwell {\&} Smith, 2012). The studies reviewed in the article serve to motivate further experiments on innovation and dissemination in human cultural transmission.}
